Note: This Google Drive link contains the sample files. Due to their large size, I couldn't upload them directly to GitHub, so I'm sharing them here instead.

This repository contains sample models that I created for research work with Professor Sehgal and Professor Vibhuti Vashist from DSE. The models cover five European countries, with similar files created for each country.

Please note that this is only a portion of my work. Some other work I completed is not included here due to confidentiality.
